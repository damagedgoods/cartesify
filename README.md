# Cartesify

## What's this?

A tool to visualize a dataset in different ways. Each dataset element has several attributes with different values.

Current visualizations:
- X / Y cartesian axis, that allows to code attribute values with x, y, radius, color. The visual feature that codes each attribute can be selected in the side panel.
- Radar graphs that places each attribute in an axis.
